# User Analytics Feature Documentation

## Overview

The User Analytics feature provides an essential view into various user-related metrics in the application. This feature is crucial for understanding user demographics, activities, and trends.

## Backend Interaction

### API Request

- **Endpoint**: `GET /users/analytics/`
- **Purpose**: Fetches aggregated user analytics data.
- **Trigger**: Automatically called when the `AnalyticsPage` component is loaded or rendered.

### API Response Structure

The response is a JSON object containing the following fields:

```json
{
    "totalUsers": Integer,         // Total number of users registered in the application
    "activeUsers": Integer,        // Number of users marked as active
    "inactiveUsers": Integer,      // Number of users marked as inactive
    "usersByProfession": {         // A key-value pair object with professions and their respective user counts
        "Profession1": Integer,
        "Profession2": Integer,
        // ... more professions
    },
    "totalStaffUsers": Integer     // Total number of users with staff privileges
}
```

## Frontend Components

### UserAnalytics Component

- **Location**: `src/components/UserAnalytics.js`
- **Functionality**:
  - Initiates an API request to the backend upon component mount.
  - Parses and sets the response data to its local state.
- **State Variables**:
  - `totalUsers`: Integer indicating the total number of users.
  - `activeUsers`: Integer indicating the number of active users.
  - `inactiveUsers`: Integer indicating the number of inactive users.
  - `usersByProfession`: Object representing the count of users by profession.
  - `totalStaffUsers`: Integer indicating the number of staff users.
- **UI**: The component currently does not have an elaborate UI. It directly displays the fetched data as text within paragraph and list elements.

### AnalyticsPage Component

- **Location**: Assumed to be in `src/pages/AnalyticsPage.js`
- **Functionality**: Serves as a container for the `UserAnalytics` component.
- **UI**: Contains a header for the Analytics Dashboard and renders the `UserAnalytics` component.

## Usage

To view the analytics:

1. Navigate to the Analytics Dashboard page in the application.
2. The analytics data is automatically fetched and displayed on the page load.

## Future Scope

- **Enhanced UI**: Integration with UI libraries for improved data presentation.
- **Data Visualization**: Implementation of charts and graphs for a more intuitive understanding of the data.
- **Real-time Updates**: Incorporating real-time data fetching to keep the analytics updated.
